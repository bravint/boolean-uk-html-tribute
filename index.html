      Origins
    </h2>

    <p>
      The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile
      Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des
      Établissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable
      centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair
      to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly
      acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting
      Observatory built in New York City in 1853. In May 1884, working at home,
      Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as "a great pylon,
      consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming
      together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular
      intervals". Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve
      further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the
      head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the
      design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a
      glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the
      patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out,
      and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in
      the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel
      presented his plans to the Société des Ingénieurs Civils; after discussing
      the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he
      finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise not only the art of
      the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which
      we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific
      movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which
      this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.

      Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grévy was re-elected as
      president of France and Édouard Lockroy was appointed as minister for
      trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy
      announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held
      for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection
      of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a
      study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars. (A
      300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort). On 12
      May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals,
      which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were
      either impractical or lacking in details. After some debate about the
      exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887.
      Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the
      representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.5 million
      francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated
      6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial
      exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years.
      He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up
      half the necessary capital himself.

      The Exposition

      The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31
      March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials,
      accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.
      Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot,
      and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various
      features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few,
      including the structural engineer, Émile Nouguier, the head of
      construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and
      reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustré, completed the ascent. At
      2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun
      salute fired at the first level.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities,
      and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the
      opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been
      completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly
      30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts
      entered service on 26 May. Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3
      for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,
      and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.
    </p>

    <p>
      After dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent
      out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on
      a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the
      exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced
      by a cannon at the top.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the second level, the French newspaper Le Figaro had an office and a
      printing press, where a special souvenir edition, Le Figaro de la Tour,
      was made. There was also a pâtisserie.At the top, there was a post office
      where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their
      visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on
      the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower.
      Gustave Eiffel described some of the responses as vraiment curieuse
      ("truly curious").
    </p>

    <p>
      Famous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah
      Bernhardt, "Buffalo Bill" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at
      the exposition) and Thomas Edison. Eiffel invited Edison to his private
      apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of
      his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the
      exposition. Edison signed the guestbook with this message: To M Eiffel the
      Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern
      Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all
      Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.
    </p>

      Eiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be
      dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris.
      The City had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules
      for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the
      tower proved to be valuable for radio telegraphy, it was allowed to remain
      after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the
      International Time Service.
